## Problem 273

Technical interview question asked by Apple.

Find a Fixed Point in a given array.

A fixed point in an array is an element whose value is equal to its index if one exists. Otherwise, return False.

For example, given [-6, 0, 2, 40], you should return 2. Given [1, 5, 7, 8], you should return False.
